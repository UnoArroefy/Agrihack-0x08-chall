# MATSM

I just learned x86 asm instruction, now i can do subtraction, addition, multiplication, and even bit shifting. this is my notes after taking the course don't forget to submit the flag with this format

## Flag Format

`agrihack{$ebx_$eax_$edi}`

Note : 
- $ represent value inside the register, if eax contain value of 120 then $eax is 120
- register value before program prepare to call exit

e.g : `agrihack{1000_100_10}`
